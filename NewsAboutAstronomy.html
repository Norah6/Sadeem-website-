					<h2> Hubble spies a dazzling collision between two galaxies in Hercules </h2>
					<p> The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two biggest players in our galactic neighborhood. With each galaxy weighing in at roughly a trillion times the mass of the Sun, they serve as the gravitational anchors that prevent our Local Group — a collection of more than 50 galaxies — from flying apart. However, because these two behemoths are so massive, they're also destined to collide in some 4 billion years, give or take, which will throw our quiet corner of the cosmos into chaos. </p>

					<h2> Daylight Savings Time makes Venus a tempting target </h2>
					<p>NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine was at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday to talk about the proposed NASA budget for 2020.
					While Bridenstine referred to the Trump administration’s proposed NASA budget as “strong,” and emphasized that funding for spaceflight exploration is high, the budget proposal also strikes funding from some missions. And, in total, it allocates $500 million less than what Congress appropriated for NASA last year.</p>

					<h2> SpaceX’s Crew Dragon splashed down back on Earth, safely completing its mission </h2>
					<p>SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule departed the International Space Station early Friday morning and began a series of thruster burns that steered the ship back toward Earth, where it safely splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean not long after 7:30 a.m. EST. The craft had been attached to the space station since Sunday, when it made its first docking under its own power after a successful Saturday launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
